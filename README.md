# distributedMachineLearning
This work combines differential privacy and multi-party computation protocol to achieve distributed machine learning. Based on the paper "Distributed Learning without Distress: Privacy-Preserving Empirical Risk Minimization" (\url{http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7871-distributed-learning-without-distress-privacy-preserving-empirical-risk-minimization}) that has been accepted at NIPS 2018.

The code contains privacy preserving implementation of L2 Regularized Logistic Regression and Linear Regression models.
